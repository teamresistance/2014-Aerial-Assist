This code is **archived**.

#### Resurrection
There are a few things to note for those resurrecting this bot:
* It runs on the compactRIO
* The DriverStation must use the 2014 protocol
* This code was originally written using NetBeans
* This was before WPILib had [proper versioning](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/design-docs/blob/master/Version%20Generation.adoc)
  * Officially, the WPILib version is "Java 2014 Update 0"
  * Don't worry about digging it up, it's bundled in app.jar under `/build`
